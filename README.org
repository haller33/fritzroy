** the Idea

Experiments on interpreters and self evaluated interpreters on Scheme and Lisp

understanding the fundamental structures of computer science and understanding fo interpretation
self interpretation and beeond

** whats next ?

The current situation are, we do need to create state since our **handmade** interpreters
have problems because is a pure-function with no side effects or hability to comunicate with the
outside world... quess what ? we have learning how to make they finaly realise they
gen of knowlegde to us... using Monad and category theory for composition and 'self' evaluation (future!)


*** List TODO

- welll first lets see

- the worder of doing this project, we need to first, create a safe handmade with `do` notation

- then port what we have done, need to use it on repl.evil.scm

- then you know...

try some forms of evalution, check Lucas implementation of the by the book implementation of a META-Circular Evaluator

try new forms of enviropment using lambdas and try to

- this is a trick question, try to get context from on interpreter and pass to another and then change the interpreter and change the way the intepreter, interpret it'self... shul be a interresting problem.... you know ? you know

** thanks

to my self, to put your self on this road of descovery and questions
