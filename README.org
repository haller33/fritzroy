** the Idea

Experiments on interpreters and self evaluated interpreters on Scheme and Lisp

understanding the fundamental structures of computer science and understanding fo interpretation
self interpretation and beeond

** whats next ?

The current situation are, we do need to create state since our **handmade** interpreters
have problems because is a pure-function with no side effects or hability to comunicate with the
outside world... quess what ? we have learning how to make they finaly realise they
gen of knowlegde to us... using Monad and category theory for composition and 'self' evaluation (future!)


** thanks

to my self, to put your self on this road of descovery and questions
